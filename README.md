Technical Information about the PC-FX


## FX-BMP Card-Edge pinout (on the FX-BMP cartridge)

Orientation:
When looking at the FX-BMP cartridge, the side which looks like the "top" (has the
branding identification) is rotated to face left for insertion into the PC-FX.
The "underside" (which faces right when inserted into the machine) is actually the
side of the PC Board on which the parts are mounted.

This right-facing "underside" also has silkscreen printing identifying a pin
numbering system.  The pin numbered "1" is at the lower-right when inserted into
the PC-FX, and the pin numbered "25" is on the same face, opposite side (upper-right
when inserted into PC-FX).  While there is no printing identifying pins 26 through
50, I will refer to them as numbered in the same way - the reverse-side of the board
from "pin 1" will be "pin 26", and the reverse of "pin 25" will be "pin 50".

### Card-Edge Physical Dimensions

The card-edge dimensions are:
- PC Board thickness = 0.0625" (1.6mm)
- Width of board = 1.325" (33.65mm)
- Pin spacing is 0.05" (1.27mm)

A near-match card edge connector is made by TE Connectivity, part 5650719-1 ... but the slot is a bit too short;
a dremel tool with the right bit can extend the slot by the needed amount (its slot is 1.310"; this would need to
be extended by about 0.01" on each side, or 0.25mm on each side).

### Electrical Signals

Since a relatively common static RAM was used on the board, many of the electrical
signals were possible to be decoded.  However, an ASIC was mounted on the board,
governing many control signals.  As the FX-BMP is battery-backed, and the PC-FX can
detect when the batteries are low, it is not clear whether the ASIC has a memory-mapped
register for battery level, or whether analog comparators are used.

It is also not yet clear whether 5V or 3.3V logic is used for the SRAM and other signals.
Based on the part number of the SRAM - uPD431000AGW-70L - it is likely going to be a 5V bus.

### Apparent function:

The CPLD appears to have two functions:
1) To perform address-decoding for the /OE line for the SRAM.
- It appears to do this based on inputs from bus pins 24, 49, 50 (likely all address lines),
and pin 45 (likely bus /OE).  It is less likely that bus pins 36 or 42 are invovled, but still
possible.
2) To monitor the voltage level of the batteries and report on it back to the PC-FX. This appears
to be sent via D0, based on some address decoded from the various other bus pins (clearly addresses,
plus /OE). The singaling approach is not yet clear, nor is the way in which the CPLD receives power
level data (voltage-controlled oscillator ?  Multi-level comparators ?)
